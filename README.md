## MinnieTaskQueue

This is a series of [python-task-queue](https://github.com/seung-lab/python-task-queue/) compatible functions for doing large scale analysis problems on EM datasets. They are customized scripts written by Forrest Collman for doing an eclectic series of tasks.  They are being developed in the open but with no intention that they would be utilized by anybody else, so no level of support is currently being offered.
